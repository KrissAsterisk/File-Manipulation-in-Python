        Asks what to do & shows current dir
        User inputs file or directory - it checks whether its a directory
        if yes: it goes to that directory
        if no: it stores the path of the file
        otherwise: prompt again
        with the path of the file, the user can now read/write/etc.
        More to be added than just files as time goes on
