        #Asks what to do & shows current dir
        #User inputs something irrlevat - nothing happens
        #User inputs file or directory - it checks whether its a directory
        #if yes: it goes to that directory
        #if no: it stores the path of the file
        #with the path of the file, the user can now read/write/etc.
